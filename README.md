This repository contains code to support the examples in the Apex Calculus textbook which is included
in this repo.

All derivatives are computed outside the notebook and then translated into Python. 

For help with integration and differentiation, I strongly recommend the pro version of Wolfram Alpha.

!!Please note that I intend to limit my work to cover the Calculus III section only!!
